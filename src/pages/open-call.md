As part of this project we are holding an open call exhibition of photographic work responding to the themes of _Landscape, People, and Place_.

The response to the open call was far broader than we could have imagined, with submissions coming in from artists in Chile, Svalbard, Costa Rica, France, Ireland, Malaysia, Iceland, all across Scotland and the UK to mention just a few.

The open call focuses on the images submitted, with a link to each artist's website or other professional page if you would like to learn more about the work.

The breadth of the response demonstrates the vital importance of this specific theme to photographic work. The open call has become an integral element of the _Imagining an Island_ project as a whole, and I hope that this is the starting point for an ongoing collaborative project with the artists involved.

We are pleased to soft launch on the 1st August with a plan to hold a more formal 'opening' in due course - details soon.

Thank you to all the artists for being part of this.
