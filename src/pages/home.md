Welcome to the _Imagining an Island_ Project. 

_Imagining an Island_ is a collaborative project, initiated by Professor John Kippin and Nicola Neate, which sprung from their ongoing photographic project [In This Day and Age](https://inthisdayandage.org "In This Day and Age"). 

_Imaging an Island_ has developed as a Symposium, two accompanying exhibitions, and an Open Call exhibition. The Symposium was due to be held at Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum and Arts Centre in North Uist in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak we have decided to hold the symposium online, move the Open Call exhibition to a virtual show and the galleries at the Arts Centre will be gradually re-opened in accordance with gov. advice.

On this site you will find information about the Symposium, the accompanying exhibition and the full Open Call virtual exhibition.
