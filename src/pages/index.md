In association with [Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum and Arts Centre](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org "Taigh Chearsabhagh"), UHI Centre For Rural Creativity and the [Art School at University of the Highlands and Islands, North Uist](https://www.instagram.com/artschoolhebrides/?hl=en "Art School Hebrides"), in Scotland's Outer Hebrides.

_Imagining an Island_ is a collaborative project, initiated by Professor John Kippin and Nicola Neate, initiated by their ongoing photographic project [In This Day and Age](https://inthisdayandage.org "In This Day and Age").

_Imaging an Island_ has developed as a Symposium, two accompanying exhibitions, and an Open Call exhibition.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak we have decided to hold the symposium virtually. This will take place the 25th and 26th September 2020. Registration available soon.

The galleries at the Arts Centre will be gradually re-opened in accordance with gov. advice, but the two accompanying exhibitions are available to be viewed virtually on Taigh Chearsabhagh's 360 virtual tour [(click here!)](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org/tcvr360storage/now/?lang=en "Exhibitions virtual").

On the _Imagining an Island_ site you will find information about the Symposium, the accompanying exhibitions and the full Open Call virtual exhibition.
