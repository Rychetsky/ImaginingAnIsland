Welcome to the _Imagining an Island_ Project. 

_Imagining an Island_ is a collaborative project, initiated by Professor John Kippin and Nicola Neate, which sprung from their ongoing photographic project [In This Day and Age](https://inthisdayandage.org "In This Day and Age"). 

_Imaging an Island_ has developed as a Symposium, two accompanying exhibitions, and an Open Call exhibition. The Symposium was due to be held at [Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum and Arts Centre ](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org "Taigh Chearsabhagh")in North Uist in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. 

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak we have decided to hold the symposium online, and move the Open Call exhibition to a virtual show. and the galleries at the Arts Centre will be gradually re-opened in accordance with gov. advice, but the two accompanying exhibitions are available to be viewed virtually on Taigh Chearsabhagh website [(click here!)](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org/tcvr360storage/now/?lang=en "Exhibitions virtual").

On this site you will find information about the Symposium, the accompanying exhibition and the full Open Call virtual exhibition.
