In association with [Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum and Arts Centre](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org/), UHI Centre For Rural Creativity and the [Art School at University of the Highlands and Islands, North Uist](https://www.instagram.com/artschoolhebrides/?hl=en), in Scotland's Outer Hebrides.

**_Imagining an Island_** is a collaborative project, initiated by Professor John Kippin and Nicola Neate, which has evolved from their ongoing photographic project [In This Day and Age](https://inthisdayandage.org/).

**_Imagining an Island_** has developed as a Symposium, two accompanying exhibitions - **_In This Day and Age_**, **_Ecognosis_** - and an **_Open Call_** exhibition.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the symposium will now be virtual and will take place as a live online event on the **25th and 26th September 2020**. Registration available soon.

**_In This Day and Age_** and **_Ecognosis_** will be available to be viewed virtually on Taigh Chearsabhagh's 360 virtual tour [(click here!)](https://www.taigh-chearsabhagh.org/tcvr360storage/now/?lang=en).

On this site you will find information about the Symposium, the accompanying exhibitions and the full Open Call virtual exhibition.
