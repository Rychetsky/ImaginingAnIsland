**IMAGINING an ISLAND**

September 25th-26th 2020

A two-day Virtual Symposium foregrounding Contemporary Landscape Practices in Photography and Film

The Symposium, Imagining an Island, is based on the Isle of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides. Due to the COVID-19 situation we will now be holding the event entirely virtually. An event booking link will be available soon.

_An island is a singular place, its boundaries are clearly defined. It is both a microcosm of the World and a philosophical idea. It is a place that invites departure and return and it is a place that engages our imagination whilst continually inspiring re-definition. How have artists responded to these concepts, and how can we further engage with, and develop our understanding of these ideas through Arts Practice?_

Using a range of approaches with Contemporary Artists working in Photography and Film, this event will explore the inter-connectedness between people and places, and ask how this is changing and offering new perspectives, due to newly developed technologies and the availability of virtual communication. The Symposium will address our assumptions around identity, belonging, culture and citizenship along with questioning the development of new identities as a result of global diaspora.

We will be exploring Contemporary Rural Life, moving away from the prevalent idealised and nostalgic representations, questioning who is defining and shaping the culture and landscape today, and assessing how artists responses to these new practices sit within more conventional and historic frameworks.

Exhibitions by John Kippin and Nicola Neate; Amund Bentsen and Benjamin Skop together with an open photographic exhibition curated by Rosie Blake will be open during the Symposium. There will be film showings and performance events curated by Andy Mackinnon included in the programme.
